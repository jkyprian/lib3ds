	* updated lib3ds_material_dump
	* added lib3ds_file_bounding_box
	* Release 1.1.0

2001-06-07  J E Hoffmann  <je-h@gmx.net>

	* write only necessary chunks to .3ds file
	* file.h/file.c: renamed lib3ds_open to lib3ds_file_load
	  removed lib3ds_close (use lib3ds_file_free instead !!)
          created lib3ds_file_save.
	* Added msvc project file to create a dll.
	* LIB3DS_KFHDR remains unchanged when saving a previously loaded file.

2001-06-05  J E Hoffmann  <je-h@gmx.net>

	* node.h/node.c, file.h/file.c: renamed "id" to node_id
	* recreated MSVC project files. Only static library creation
	  supported at the moment.

2001-05-08  Michael Fink  <michael.fink@redspark.com>

	* in lib3ds_atmosphere_write() the two chunk id's were accidentally swapped
	* in lib3ds_mesh_write(), the chunks were reordered to enable a successful 
	  import into AutoCAD 2000i and 3d Studio MAX 3.1
	* in the struct _Lib3dsMapData the "maptype" data member was added, increasing
	  the size of the chunk LIB3DS_MESH_TEXTURE_INFO to 92 bytes (as seen in 3ds 
	  files from 3d Studio)
	* the chunk LIB3DS_SHADOW_RANGE contains, according to the 3ds file development
	  kit (3ds-fdk) a dword chunk; reading and writing the chunk should be fixed.

2001-03-20  J E Hoffmann  <je-h@gmx.net>

	* examples/3dsplay.c: new simples 3dsplayer example
	  using glut. msvc support only at the moment.
	* lib3ds/mesh.c: started working on vertex normal support
	  (smoothing not supported at the moment, can't test them)
	* Doxygen documentation files changed from *.doc to *.txt
	  to avoid collisions with MS-Word on windows platforms

	* lib3ds/material.c (lib3ds_material_dump): 
	  Added dumping of ambient, diffuse, specular, shininess, 
	  shin_strength, shading and texture1/texture2 properties
	* examples/3dsdump.c (main):

2001-01-09  J E Hoffmann  <je-h@gmx.net>

	* lib3ds/mesh.c (lib3ds_mesh_write): 
	  the point list is no loner retransformed to avoid numerical problems.
	  to use meshes with the keyframer all points must be transformed
	  by the inverse mesh-matrix manually.

	  bugfix LIB3DS_N_CAMERA (fov)
	* lib3ds/light.c (lib3ds_light_write):

	* lib3ds/mesh.c: Added missing texture mapping handling
	  LIB3DS_TEX_VERTS 
	  LIB3DS_MESH_TEXTURE_INFO
